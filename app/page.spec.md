  - Shows an English "Feature Index" (not a workflow). Pages are independent features; the index briefly explains each and where its inputs/outputs reside:
    - 1. Syncro Checkerboard Shots — capture frames from selected cameras; saves to `1-syncro-checkerboard_shots/<ts>/cam-<name>.(rgb|gray)`.
    - 2. Calibrate Scenes — detects corners and computes per‑camera intrinsics/extrinsics and undistortion maps (single‑camera workflow). Writes artifacts under `2-calibrate-scenes/<runTs>/` including per‑camera `cam-<name>_calibration.json` and `cam-<name>_remapXY.xy`.
    - 6. Cameras Homography — select Camera A/B and a single shared timestamp; displays undistorted previews and computes a homography from that pair. Saves undist frames and JSON under `6-cameras-homography/<runTs>/`.
    - 3. Remap Realtime — lists detected remap fields (per‑camera undistortion) and previews the chosen field; live WebGL application is being integrated.
  - Do not render a page-link banner above main content.
  - Sidebars (persistent):
    - Left: File System
    - Right: Device Settings
    - Both widths are user-resizable via drag and are persisted across pages.
  - File preview: when a file is selected in the sidebar file system, render a 2D Canvas preview under the index.
